// TO DO: the registered Mach port receives both AE and non-AE messages; what should we do with the latter? would help to know what the non-AE message does - it precedes the first AE sent by a client, implying some sort of preparation (e.g. getting serverâ€™s AE entitlements info, as defined in its SDEF?)

// TO DO: what about AppKit-based processes? installing our own Mach port source may conflict with AppKit's standard AE hooks, in which case we should install a wildcard handler via Carbon/NSAppleEventManager that forwards unhandled AEs to our own dispatcher, although that smells kludgy and inefficient)

// TO DO: how should next layer above AppleEventHandler look? presumably we need some sort of app-specific glue to map Swift functions with native parameter and return types onto AppleEventHandler callbacks; should Swift functions use standardized naming conventions, allowing them to be auto-detected by glue generator and signatures mapped to 'SDEF' definitions (note: we want to architect a new, comprehensive IDL dictionary format, with basic SDEFs generated for backwards compatibility; the IDL should, as much as possible, be auto-generated from the Swift implementation)


// TO DO: what about completion callbacks for async use? (analogous to suspend/resume current event) Q. what are [dis]advantages of using completion callbacks as standard? (avoids blocking [main] thread; may be slightly more expensive, cannot guarantee callback will ever be called [although clients will typically specify timeout to avoid waiting forever])

// TO DO: may want to define AE handler as struct; that'll allow runtime introspection (the entire interface should be explorable, with any static definitions being generated from that) (if it weren't for AS's dependency on four-char code stability, we could also generate four-char codes on the fly; as it is, we will have to generate new four-char codes as delta to existing ones); another reason to use structs + protocol is that it makes it easy to support multimethods

// Q. to what extent should we use pattern-based dispatching? (e.g. we might dispatch on topmost descriptor of target query, or on topmost descriptor's parent - e.g. in `count`; we might want to walk descriptor chain from application root, with ability to register functions at any point in that graph; safe vs mutating commands will want to use different behaviors; operations on concrete vs abstract nodes - e.g. window vs word - will definitely want to process differently; and so on; subject [target] vs object [receiver] specifiers); definitely something to be said for OSL's mix-n-match approach, though ideally we want to abstract away most if not all of that boilerplate behind a declarative IDL/DSL
